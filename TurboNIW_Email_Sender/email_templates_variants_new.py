EMAIL_BODY_VARIANT_6 = """Hi {name},

Hope you're doing well.

I recently read your paper "<em>{paper_title}</em>" and found it really interesting. Your work touches on areas that are part of the U.S. Critical and Emerging Technologies list, which made me think about how NIW green cards can be relevant for researchers in these fields.

I'm Wen, and I was an international PhD student who went through the NIW process. What I remember most is how stuck many of us feel. On one hand, hiring an attorney costs a lot, often more than what's realistic for early career researchers. On the other hand, trying to do it yourself feels impossible when you don't know where to begin, what forms you need, or what a strong application looks like.

That's what led a few of us (former international PhD students) to build <strong>TurboNIW</strong>.

It's a tool that creates petition letter drafts and fills out forms, designed for people who want to handle their NIW application themselves but need a clear starting point and some guidance. We made this because we know how stressful and uncertain this process can be, and we wanted to help others feel more confident navigating it.

I'm sharing this in case it's useful to you or anyone in your network who might be dealing with NIW. No pressure at all, just wanted to pass it along. We also really appreciate when people share it with others who might benefit, and we're always happy to show our appreciation for referrals.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about the NIW process or share experiences.

Best wishes with your research!

Best,
Wen

I hope you're having a good week.

I came across your work "<em>{paper_title}</em>" and it caught my attention. Given the areas you're working in, I thought you might find it useful to know about NIW (National Interest Waiver) green cards, which can be a valuable option for researchers whose work aligns with critical technology areas.

Let me introduce myself: I'm Wen, a former international PhD student. When I was going through the NIW application, I realized how tough the situation is for many researchers. Attorney fees are often quite high, which makes it difficult for many of us, while the DIY approach feels overwhelming because there's no clear roadmap for beginners on where to start, what forms to complete, or how to structure everything.

After finishing my degree, I worked with a few others who had similar experiences, and together we created <strong>TurboNIW</strong>.

The idea is to provide petition drafts and completed forms, giving people a solid foundation if they want to handle NIW themselves. We built this because we understand how challenging and uncertain this journey can be, and we wanted to help others navigate it with more confidence and less stress.

I'm sharing this purely as a resource, in case it's helpful for you, your students, or colleagues who might be navigating NIW. Totally optional, just wanted to pass it along. We also value peer recommendations, so if you know anyone who might benefit, we'd appreciate you sharing it with them, and we're always happy to show our appreciation for referrals.

Happy to chat more about NIW anytime!

Hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to reach out because I recently saw your work titled "<em>{paper_title}</em>". It's really impressive, and it reminded me of how many international researchers are working on technologies that fall under the U.S. government's Critical and Emerging Technologies framework, which can make NIW green card pathways quite relevant.

I'm Wen, and I used to be an international PhD student in the U.S. Going through the NIW process myself, I quickly learned how difficult it can be. Many of us face a challenging situation: attorney costs can be quite high, which isn't always feasible, while trying to do it yourself feels like you're lost without a guide, not knowing where to start or what the process should look like.

To help address this, a few of us who went through the same experience built a straightforward tool called <strong>TurboNIW</strong>.

It helps generate petition drafts and completed forms, designed for researchers who want to take control of their NIW application but need a clearer roadmap and guidance. We created this because we know how stressful and uncertain this process can be, and we wanted to help others feel more confident navigating it.

I'm not pushing this at all, just sharing in case it's useful to you, your students, or colleagues dealing with NIW.

I hope you're doing well.

I came across your recent paper "<em>{paper_title}</em>" and found it quite interesting, especially in the context of U.S. immigration pathways for researchers. As someone whose research aligns with critical technology areas, you might already be aware that the NIW green card can be an important option for academics and researchers.

A bit about me: I'm Wen, a former international PhD student who went through the NIW process myself. One thing that stands out from that experience is how overwhelming it can feel. Many of us face a tough situation: attorney fees can be quite high, which makes it difficult for many researchers, while trying to do it yourself feels impossible without guidance on where to start or what the process should look like.

After finishing my degree, I teamed up with a few others (former PhD students) to build something that could help. We created <strong>TurboNIW</strong>, a DIY tool that generates petition drafts and completes forms.

It's meant to reduce the stress and uncertainty for people who want to handle NIW on their own but don't know where to begin. We know how challenging this process can be, and we wanted to create something that could help others navigate it with more confidence and less anxiety.

I wanted to share this with you in case it's helpful, either for yourself or for any international students or colleagues who might be dealing with NIW.
