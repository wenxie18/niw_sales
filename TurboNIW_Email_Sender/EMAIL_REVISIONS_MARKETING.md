# Email Template Revisions — Marketing & Professional Perspective

## 🎯 Goals of These Revisions

1. **Reduce Spam Risk** — Remove elements that trigger spam filters
2. **Increase Trust** — Make emails feel helpful, not salesy
3. **Reduce Reporting** — People won't mark as spam if it feels valuable
4. **Professional Tone** — Peer-to-peer sharing, not commercial pitch

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Subject Line Revision

**Before:**
- "Hello from Wen, impressed by your recent work"

**After:**
- "Hello from Wen, a resource for NIW applications"

**Why:**
- ❌ "Impressed by your work" implies the email is sent *because* of their work
- ✅ "Resource for NIW" makes it clear it's about sharing a helpful tool
- ✅ Aligns with goal: sharing resource, not responding to their work

---

### 2. Removed All Explicit Price Mentions

**Removed phrases:**
- ❌ "$8,000–$10,000+"
- ❌ "half a month of PhD stipend"
- ❌ "thousands of dollars"
- ❌ "much lower cost"
- ❌ "affordable price point"
- ❌ "financial burden"

**Why this matters:**
- **Spam filters flag price mentions** — Common in phishing/scam emails
- **Too salesy** — Makes it feel like a commercial pitch
- **Triggers skepticism** — People think "why are they telling me about prices?"
- **Less professional** — Price discussions feel transactional

---

### 3. Reframed Value Proposition

**Before (Price-focused):**
- "Attorney fees are expensive, so we made something cheaper"

**After (Value-focused):**
- "The DIY route is confusing, so we made something to help guide you"

**Key messaging now:**
- ✅ Focus on **challenge** (confusion, uncertainty, lack of guidance)
- ✅ Focus on **help** (clear guidance, starting point, roadmap)
- ✅ Focus on **value** (reducing stress, providing clarity)
- ❌ **No mention of cost** (implicit benefit, not explicit)
